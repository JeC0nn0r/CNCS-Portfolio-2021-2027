Pfsense Firewall (fw01) | WAN = em0 | LAN = em1 |
- The LAN address of fw01 (.5.2) acts as the default gateway for wks01 (.5.100)
- The WAN address of fw01 (.17.109) goes upstream to .17.2
- Address conflicts will occur (as usual) if someone uses the same WAN address as me by mistake.
Workstation 01 (wks01) | .5.100 |
- Windows 10
- Default gateway of 5.2 (LAN address of fw01)
- Can access and/or ping Champlain.edu if no address conflicts occur
Notes
- Brush up on traceroute / tracert
- Look more into powershell
- Start the next labs before next class if schedule is free
