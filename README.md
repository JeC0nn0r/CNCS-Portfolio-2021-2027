While I did start working with computer networks in my junior year of high school. My progress got more notable in 2022 when I was tasked with renovating the student Networking and Cybersecurity lab of my voc-tech school before graduation. In the end, I had installed multiple vendor neutral servers, most of which I built myself, more than 15 Cisco enterprise switches and routers for each rack, and multiple Cisco ASAs.
