# CNCS Tech Portfolio

This is the collective portfolio of my hands-on work with designing networks, such as student networking labs, and my logical work and studies. It spans from my junior year of high school, when I was working as an IT Support Technician, to my eventual graduation from Champlain College and beyond.

## Who am I?

My name is Connor. I'm an expected 2027 Graduate of Champlain College, and currently a Network Systems Engineer as of 2024. I've had a penchant for computers I was little. I have had the passion of learning how everything around me works and how to deconstruct it. My father encouraged me to put my attitude to use as I got older, and I began a journey I never would have imagined.

## Where is my information stored?

Most of my writing will be stored in the Wiki, however there will be files stored elsewhere over time.
