# CNCS Portfolio 2021-2027

This is the collective portfolio of my hands-on work with designing networks, such as student networking labs, and my logical work and studies. It spans from my junior year of high school to my eventual graduation from Champlain College.

## Who am I?

My name is Connor. I'm an expected 2027 Graduate of Champlain College, and an Network Systems Engineer of the Leahy Center for Digital Forensics.

## Why 2021? 

I began to work with computer networks in my junior year of High School. I was tasked with renovating the student Networking and Cybersecurity lab of my voc-tech school before graduation in my senior year. In the end, I had installed multiple vendor neutral servers, most of which I built myself, more than 15 Cisco enterprise switches and routers for each rack, and multiple Cisco ASAs.
