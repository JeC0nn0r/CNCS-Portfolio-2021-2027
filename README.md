# Champlain-College-CNCS-Notes

This is a work-in-progress portfolio of my work at Champlain College and will include topics such as class labs and my notes.

## Who am I?

My name is Connor. I'm a Computer Networking & Cybersecurity major at Champlain College slated to graduate a full year early, and currently the team supervisor for Network Systems Engineering of the college-affiliated Senator Leahy Center for Digital Forensics and Investigation. I've had a penchant for computers I was little. I have had the passion of learning how everything around me works and how to deconstruct it. My father encouraged me to put my attitude to use as I got older, and I began a journey I never would have imagined.

## Where is my information stored?

Most of my writing will be stored in the Wiki, however there will be files stored elsewhere over time. This includes course files (eg. Powershell and Bash scripts), which will be stored in their respective course directories if applicable.
